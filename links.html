        The English Wikipedia has pioneered some ideas as conventions,<br> policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. <br>These ideas include "featured articles",[5] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[6] navigation templates,[7] <br>the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[8] dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[9] and weekly collaborations.[10]

It surpassed six million articles on 23 January 2020.[11] In August 2020,<br> the total volume of the compressed texts of its articles amounted to 18.6 gigabytes.[12]

The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021 by Ser Amantio di Nicolao (Steven Pruitt) who as of that date is the user with the highest number of edits on the English Wikipedia, at over four million.[4] Currently, there are 6,487,423 articles created with 892,790 files.

            One controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which national variety of the English language is to be preferred, some candidates being American English and British English.<br>[23] Suggestions range from standardizing upon a single form of English to forking the English Wikipedia project.<br> A style guideline states, "the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language" and "an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation".<br>
